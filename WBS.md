NomadicSky Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
This Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) outlines the tasks for the NomadicSky project, a weather-focused AI agent for nomads, built with LangChain, Grok 3 API, and GitHub Copilot over 3 weeks (11.5-16.5 hours total, ~3.8-5.5 hours/week)..

Timeline Overview
•	Duration: 3 weeks
•	Effort: 11.5-16.5 hours (~3.8-5.5 hours/week, within 10 hours/week availability)
•	Milestones:
o	Week 1: Setup development environment, start current weather (3.75-4.75 hours).
o	Week 2: Complete current weather, add historical weather and memory (4-6 hours).
o	Week 3: Add severe weather risks and NWS details, test, and document (3.75-5.75 hours).

Week 1: Setup + Current Weather Start (3.75-4.75 hours)
Milestone: Configure development environment, begin current weather feature.
Tasks:
1.	Project Kickoff (0.25 hour):
o	Write a kickoff note (e.g., “Starting NomadicSky: 3 weeks, weather MVP”) in KICKOFF.md.
o	Review charter/WBS, confirm laptop readiness.
2.	Install Tools (1.5-2 hours):
o	Install Python 3.10+ (verify with python --version).
o	Install Miniconda, create environment (conda create -n nomadicsky python=3.10).
o	Install VSCode, add Python extension.
o	Install Git, configure (git config --global user.name "Your Name").
o	Install GitHub Copilot extension in VSCode (sign in, $10/month or trial).
o	Install Postman (free tier) and Jupyter (pip install jupyter).
o	Install dependencies: pip install langchain langchain-xai requests.
3.	Configure APIs (0.5-1 hour):
o	Sign up for Grok 3 API (console.x.ai), obtain API key.
o	Sign up for OpenWeatherMap (openweathermap.org), obtain free API key.
o	Test APIs in Postman (e.g., OpenWeatherMap weather for Knoxville).
4.	Setup GitHub Repo (0.5 hour):
o	Create repo (github.com/yourname/NomadicSky).
o	Commit CHARTER.md (project charter).
o	Clone repo locally (git clone <repo-url>).
5.	Commit WBS to GitHub (0.25 hour):
o	Create WBS.md in repo’s root.
o	Copy this plan into WBS.md, commit with message “Add WBS.”
6.	Setup Task Tracking System (0.25 hour):
o	Create a tracking table in Notion, Excel, or GitHub Issues (e.g., Task, Status, Hours, Notes).
o	List Week 1 tasks (e.g., “Install Python: To Do”).
7.	Start Current Weather (0-0.5 hour):
o	Create nomadicsky.py in VSCode.
o	Write basic LangChain chain with Grok 3 API, using Copilot for suggestions.
o	Test simple query (e.g., “Weather in Knoxville?”).

Learning (~1 hour):
•	Read LangChain Quickstart (docs.langchain.com, 30 min).
•	Watch GitHub Copilot tutorial (YouTube, e.g., “Copilot for Python,” 30 min).

Project Management:
•	Concepts: WBS creation, task estimation, project initiation, progress monitoring.
•	Actions: Track tasks in Notion/Excel/GitHub Issues; note kickoff in KICKOFF.md.

Week 2: Current Weather Completion + Historical Weather + Memory (4-6 hours)
Milestone: Complete current weather, implement historical weather and memory.
Tasks:
1.	Complete Current Weather (1-2 hours):
o	Finalize OpenWeatherMap tool (e.g., fetch temperature, conditions).
o	Test queries (e.g., “Find warm places for next week”).
o	Use Copilot for LangChain tool syntax.
2.	Historical Weather (2-3 hours):
o	Sign up for NOAA API (ncdc.noaa.gov), obtain free token.
o	Create LangChain tool for seasonal averages (e.g., “Knoxville spring: 60-75°F”).
o	Test with Copilot-generated code.
3.	User Preference Memory (1-2 hours):
o	Implement ConversationBufferMemory for preferences (e.g., “70-80°F”).
o	Test multi-turn dialogues (e.g., “Knoxville weather?” -> “Is it like last year?”).
4.	Update Task Tracking (0.25 hour):
o	Mark Week 2 tasks as done in Notion/Excel/GitHub Issues.
o	Note any delays or issues.

Learning (~1-2 hours):
•	Read LangChain docs on tools/memory (1 hour).
•	Experiment with Copilot for LangChain patterns (30-60 min).

Project Management:
•	Concepts: Progress tracking, scope control.
•	Actions: Review tasks vs. plan, note scope creep risks (e.g., adding features).

Week 3: Severe Weather + NWS Details + Testing (3.75-5.75 hours)
Milestone: Add severe weather risks, NWS details, test, and document.
Tasks:
1.	Severe Weather Risks (1-2 hours):
o	Use NOAA/OpenWeatherMap for risks (e.g., Texas tornadoes).
o	Write LangChain tool with Copilot, test queries (e.g., “Is Texas safe in spring?”).
2.	NWS Office Details (1-2 hours):
o	Create nws_offices.json (10-20 cities, e.g., Knoxville -> @NWSMorristown).
o	Integrate JSON into responses (e.g., “Knoxville: 72°F, NWS: @NWSMorristown”).
o	Commit JSON to GitHub.
3.	Testing, Polish, README (1-2 hours):
o	Test all features (e.g., multi-turn queries, NWS integration).
o	Debug with Copilot suggestions.
o	Write README.md (setup, usage, link to CHARTER.md).
o	Commit final code.
4.	Finalize Task Tracking (0.25 hour):
o	Update Notion/Excel/GitHub Issues with Week 3 status.
o	Confirm all tasks complete.

Learning (~1 hour):
•	Review LangChain agents (docs, 30 min).
•	Explore Copilot debugging tips (YouTube, 30 min).

Project Management:
•	Concepts: Project closure, documentation.
•	Actions: Finalize README, assess success criteria (e.g., MVP functionality).
