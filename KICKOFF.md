# NomadicSky Project Kickoff

**Date**: May 31, 2025

The NomadicSky project officially begins! This 3-week, 11.5-16.5-hour project will deliver a weather-focused AI agent for nomads, using LangChain, Grok 3 API, and GitHub Copilot. The MVP will provide current weather, historical insights, severe weather risks, user preference memory, and NWS office details, supporting nomad travel planning.

**Goals**:
- Build a functional MVP within 3 weeks and $100 budget.
- Master LangChain, GitHub Copilot, and project management through hands-on development.

**Week 1 Focus**:
- Setup development environment (Python, VSCode, Copilot, APIs).
- Commit `CHARTER.md`, `WBS.md`, `KICKOFF.md`, and start current weather feature.

**Next Steps**:
- Configure laptop tools and APIs.
- Begin coding with LangChain and Copilot.
- Track progress in Excel.

Letâ€™s build NomadicSky and learn along the way!
